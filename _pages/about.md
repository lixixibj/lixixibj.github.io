He is a third-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at The University of Manchester, supervised by Dr. Jingsong Yuan. His research now is funded by the Dean's Scholarship Award. 

He is scheduled to obtain a Ph.D. degree in 07/2023 and will be in a job market seeking a Postdoc position related to statistical machine learning and time series analysis. If you have vacancies for a job, feel free to share them with me.

Research Goal
======
Following three principles: interpretability, computability, and stability, his current research aims to:

1. explore the role and use of deep learning in statistical time series models and bridge the gap between both.

2. design and develop statistical time series models that incorporate the components of deep learning, while still ensuring rigorous statistical properties.

3. develop computationally efficient statistical models for integer-valued time series analysis.

Research Interests 
======
Time series analysis

Integer-valued time series

Deep learning

Text mining

Business intelligence
