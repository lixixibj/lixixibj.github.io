He is a third-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at The University of Manchester, working with Dr. Jingsong Yuan on deep learning for multivariate time series modelling and forecasting under a Dean's Doctoral Scholarship Award. 

He is expected to obtain a Ph.D. degree in 07/2023 and will be in a job market seeking a Postdoc position related to statistical machine learning and time series analysis. If you have any vacancies for a job, feel free to share them with me.

Research Goal
======
Following three principles: interpretability, computability, and stability, his current research aims to:

* explore the role and use of deep learning in statistical time series models, and bridge the gap between both.
* design and develop statistical time series models that incorporate the components of deep learning, while still ensuring rigorous statistical properties.
* develop computationally efficient statistical models for integer-valued time series analysis.

Research Interests
======
* Time series analysis
* Integer-valued time series
* Deep learning
* Text mining
* Business intelligence
